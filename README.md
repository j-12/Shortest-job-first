SJF is a process scheduling algorithm when the burst time of the processes are know.
This program asks the user for number of processes.
It then asks the user to enter the process-id, its arrival time and the burst time.
The output is the Completion time, Turnaround time and the Waiting time for each process.
The final output, used for analyzing different scheduling algorithms are the Average TAT and Average WT
